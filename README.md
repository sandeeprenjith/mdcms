# MDCMS
 
 MDCMS is a simple content management system which lets you write your posts in markdown. 
 This project will create a website with a home, about, and admin pages.
 
 You can create the posts from the admin page in markdown. 
 
 The CMS does not provide a lot of functionality. The idea here is to make the site building process as simple as possible.
